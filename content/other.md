## My very satirical game about anarchocapitalism [Czech]

I made [this game](/other/ancap/) as a Christmas gift for my anarchocapitalist friends. It was made with Est√∫dio Vaca Roxa's [Generic Old West Pack](https://bakudas.itch.io/generic-oldwest-pack) and the music is [Scythe in Hell by XTaKeRuX](https://soundcloud.com/xtakerux/scythe-in-hell).

## Video for my high school art class [Czech]

I created [this video](https://youtu.be/vq9eB66zeP4) in 2020 as a project for my high school art class. I was inspired by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/user/Cercopithecan) and wanted to play around with GPU computing.
