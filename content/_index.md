# Welcome!

Hi, my name is Lukáš and this is my website. You can also call me Lukas or some other pronunciation :)

## What do I study?
I study **computer science** because it is a lifelong passion of mine. I am working on my Bachelor's degree at the **Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at Charles University** in Prague. I also went for a one semester exchange program (Erasmus) at the **Technical University of Munich**.

I enjoy the theoretical parts of computer science the most. My favorite topics lie in the intersection of computer science, mathematics and physics. More specifically, I am interested in scientific computing, machine learning, numerical mathematics, algorithms and optimization.

## Other interests
I enjoy hiking, camping and hitchhiking with my friends in nature or in different countries. At the end of a long day, I like to play games (computer and board games alike) with my friends while arguing about some random topic.

I love friendly debates about politics, philosophy, religion and science. In the future, I would also like to try to write about the topics of our debates. With my friend [Vojta](https://vojtech-votruba.github.io) we created a blog named [Stříbro](https://stribro.github.io) for our pseudointellectual writing in Czech, so if I ever write something, it will go there.

Sometimes I help with the organization of [KSP](https://ksp.mff.cuni.cz), a programming seminar and camp for high-schoolers.
